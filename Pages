        	<h3 align="center">Problems of India</h3>
        	<hr align="center" width="80%">
        	<br />
        	<p>
        		When we say India, we never mean Ganges of the northern land, the Deccan plateau of mid-south not even its vast geographical spread. We simply mean the people of India. So, India is nothing but us. That means if we say India is progressing that represents we are progressing, in the same way we may be its hindrance in progress too.<br />
The root of every problem remains very basic, that may look very minute yet has a great impact. A better India is nothing but a better Indian. We, citizens of India have a lot of fundamental duties that should be followed. A good citizen must follow not only the listed fundamental duties but also the unlisted ones. Keeping our surrounding clean is one of them.<br />
A positive mindset creates a positive energy and can be utilised for overcoming lots of hurdles. These days our media come up with all negativities of our society and all political mischiefs that makes people think negatively about the country. The bitter truth is that, even Indians don’t consider that they are blessed to be an Indian. This is all because of the present media show up. If we see positive, we think positive, we do positive and we become positive. We always need a spark of patriotism to show how much we love our country.<br />
If we consider about the government employees at all level and compare them with private company employees. Then definitely we will find that government employees are not doing well as expected, this is the problem of India. Every system of our country has become static and are old, we need to change the systems. It should be dynamic. There a monitor to regulate everything.<br />
One thing that government employee suffer from is, their late payment. I think this is the reason that they are not showing up their best. Delay in almost all task is the basic thing that government employee does.<br />
We Indians talk about silly topics like religion, cast, community and all over social media that restricts our progression and a civil war remains at high probability to happen. Instead of shouting about silly topics we should uplift our progress, we can talk about India’s betterment keeping all silly things aside. Even in universities and colleges, students are very much interested in all these silly topics instead of our progression talk. All these things take India back in 19’s and our progress completely stops.<br />
If we stop all these and focus on the following topics then we may find a better India:
        	</p>
        	<br>•	Improving agricultural activities and helping them who are related to it. Students may find a better and advanced way of farming like Intensive Farming for better production.
        	</br>
        	<br>
        		•	Cleanliness, helpfulness, help in killing poverty must be on focus of every Indian.
        	</br>
        	<br>
        		•	A faith of patriotism must be there in everyone’s heart.
        	</br>
        	<br>
        		•	Development of all round skills in young students in every field to reduce unemployment.
        	</br>
        	<br>
        		•	Thinking of new renewable resources of energy apart from traditional coal based power plant will help us for better tomorrow.
        	</br>
        	<br>
        		•	We must ignore silly topics on religion, cast, community and all.
        	</br>
        	<br>
        		•	We must uphold responsibility of good citizenship and hence our media must be very cautious about selecting things what to show and what not to show.
        	</br>
        	<br>
        		•	A bribe free environment should be in our country to have a healthy government employee’s environment.
